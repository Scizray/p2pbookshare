      GEMINI_PRO_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_PRO_API_KEY
      FIREBASAE_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
      ```

    - **Google Maps API Key:** Create a project in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and enable the Google Maps Platform APIs and obtain the API key.
    - **Gemini Pro API Key:** Obtain currently Gemini Pro API key, which is free of cost as of now [here](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
    - **Firebase Project Information:** Create a Firebase project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and note down the Project ID and API Key for Cloud Messaging.

4. Configure Firebase for both iOS and Android platforms:
    - Ensure the `build.gradle` file is properly set up and includes all necessary Firebase dependencies. Add the `google-services.json` file for Android and the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file for iOS to your project. Additionally, create and include the `firebase_options.dart` file in the lib/ directory to manage Firebase configuration options.

5. Configure both debug and release builds in the app/`build.gradle` file. Create and properly set up the `key.properties` file to securely manage your signing keys and other sensitive information.

    ```properties
    keyAlias=key-alias
    keyPassword=key-password
    storeFile=/path/to/kestore
    storePassword=key-store-password
    ```

6. Create a service account within the Google Cloud Console and obtain the `service_account.json` file, which is used for sending push notifications on Android. Place this file in the assets/fcm/ folder of your project.

    - Navigate to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
    - Go to the "IAM & Admin" section and select "Service Accounts".

    - Click "Add Key" and select "Create New Key".
    - Choose "JSON" format and click "Create".
